Using these letters, you will be able to a few new phrases!

This is perhaps the first time you will see some constantant clusters which are unusual for native english speakers to pronounce, such as "მქვ" (mkv) in "მქვია" (mkvia). Don't worry, there isn't any 'trick' to it, just pronounce all the letters you see (in order, from left to right!). You can check out the Peace Corps Georgia video this lesson is taken from (link below) to hear how Keti, a native speaker, pronounces it.
