Welcome! I hope you enjoy learning Georgian as much as I do.

This lesson is based off an excellent video made by Peace Corps Georgia:

I highly recommended that you watch this series if you've just started learning Georgian. It's a very good introduction, especially for learning the letters and sounds of the Georgian alphabet.

The transliteration of these letters into English, that is, the letter that is used to represent them if we are writing Georgian with an English keyboard, is all the same letter as I've used in the below examples to demonstrate the sound that they make. For example, მამა is transliterated as "mama".

ა - Sounds like 'a' in cat
მ - Sounds like 'm' in mountain
ო - Sounds like 'o' in octopus
გ - Sounds like 'g' in great
რ - Sounds like 'r' in ravioli (roll the 'r' slightly)
ჯ - Sounds like 'j' in journey
