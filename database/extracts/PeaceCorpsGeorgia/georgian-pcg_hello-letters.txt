Welcome! I hope you enjoy learning Georgian as much as I do.

This lesson is based off an excellent video made by Peace Corps Georgia:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8tUdxFOOIU.

I highly recommended that you watch this series if you've just started learning Georgian. It's a very good introduction, especially for learning the letters and sounds of the Georgian alphabet.

ა - Sounds like 'a' in cat
მ - Sounds like 'm' in mountain
ო - Sounds like 'o' in octopus
გ - Sounds like 'g' in great
რ - Sounds like 'r' in ravioli (roll the 'r' slightly)
ჯ - Sounds like 'j' in journey
