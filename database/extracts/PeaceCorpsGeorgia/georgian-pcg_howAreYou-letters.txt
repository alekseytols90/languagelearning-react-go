I highly recommended that you watch this series if you've just started learning Georgian. It's a very good introduction, especially for learning the letters and sounds of the Georgian alphabet.

დ - Sounds like 'd' in diary
ხ - Sounds like 'ch' in Bach. ხ is transliterated as x.
ლ - Sounds like 'l' in learn
კ - Sounds like 'k' in kit. კ is transliterated as k'.

ხ and კ make sounds unlike any used normally in English, so I'll explain them in more detail.

ხ is a consonantal sound which resembles the 'ch' in the name of the German composer Bach. Another example is the 'ch' in the scottish word 'loch'. It's technical name is "voiceless velar fricative" - there is an example of this sound at:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_velar_fricative

კ is one of many letters in Georgian whose sound is described as 'ejective' or 'aspirated'. If you make a normal 'k' sound in English, such as in the word 'kit', you'll realise that the sound is produced from contact between your tongue and the roof of your mouth. If you press your tongue a bit harder against the roof of your mouth, this will help you pronounce კ more easily.

კ is transliterated as k'. The apostrophe indicates that the sound is ejective, or aspirated, unlike ქ which is not. ქ is transliterated as k.
