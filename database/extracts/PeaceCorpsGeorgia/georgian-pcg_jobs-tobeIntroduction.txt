I highly recommended that you watch this series if you've just started learning Georgian. It's a very good introduction, especially for learning the letters and sounds of the Georgian alphabet.

Here is a conjugation of the singular forms of the verb 'to be' in Georgian:

მე ვარ - I am
(me var)

შენ ხარ - You are
(shen xar)

ის არის - She/he/it is
(is aris)

Nouns do not have gender in Georgian. ის can refer to a single she, he or it.
