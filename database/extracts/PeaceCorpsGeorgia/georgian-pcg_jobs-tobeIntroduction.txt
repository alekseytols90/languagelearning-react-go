I highly recommended that you watch this series if you've just started learning Georgian. It's a very good introduction, especially for learning the letters and sounds of the Georgian alphabet.

Here is a conjugation of the singular forms of the verb 'to be' in Georgian:

მე ვარ - I am
(me var)

შენ ხარ - You are
(shen xar)

ის არის - She/he/it is
(is aris)

Nouns do not have gender in Georgian. ის can refer to a single she, he or it.

Here are a few jobs:

დირექტორი - Director
(direktori)

მენეჯერი - Manager
(menejeri)

მოხალისე - Volunteer
(moxalise)

In Georgian it is common for the verb to go last, but in general word order is flexible, so a word can be brought forwards in the sentence to emphasise its importance.

Georgian is also a 'pro-drop' language, so the pronoun can be dropped if meaning is preserved, thanks to verb agreement.

The following three Georgian sentences therefore all mean "I am a volunteer"

მე მოხალისე ვარ.
მე ვარ მოხალისე.
მოხალისე ვარ.
